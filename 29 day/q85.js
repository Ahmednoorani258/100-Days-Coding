// Question 85: Finding the Position of a Substring: Write a function that locates the first occurrence of the word "code" within any given string and returns its position.
// Explain & TIP: Use .indexOf() to find where a certain piece of text starts within a larger string. If the text isn't found, this method returns -1.
function finder(line, word) {
    console.log(line.indexOf(word));
}
finder("the blue color is my fav", "blue");
