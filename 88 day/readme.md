Creating Layouts and Pages
So far, your application only has a home page. Let's learn how you can create more routes with layouts and pages.

In this chapter...

Here are the topics we’ll cover

Create the dashboard routes using file-system routing.

Understand the role of folders and files when creating new route segments.

Create a nested layout that can be shared between multiple dashboard pages.

Understand what colocation, partial rendering, and the root layout are.

Nested routing
Next.js uses file-system routing where folders are used to create nested routes. Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment.

You can create separate UIs for each route using layout.tsx and page.tsx files.

page.tsx is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. In your application, you already have a page file: /app/page.tsx - this is the home page associated with the route /.

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other and add page.tsx files inside them. For example:

Diagram showing how adding a folder called dashboard creates a new route '/dashboard'
/app/dashboard/page.tsx is associated with the /dashboard path. Let's create the page to see how it works!

Creating the dashboard page
Create a new folder called dashboard inside /app. Then, create a new page.tsx file inside the dashboard folder with the following content:

/app/dashboard/page.tsx

export default function Page() {
  return <p>Dashboard Page</p>;
}
Now, make sure that the development server is running and visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard. You should see the "Dashboard Page" text.

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js: create a new route segment using a folder, and add a page file inside it.

By having a special name for page files, Next.js allows you to colocate UI components, test files, and other related code with your routes. Only the content inside the page file will be publicly accessible. For example, the /ui and /lib folders are colocated inside the /app folder along with your routes.

Practice: Creating the dashboard pages
Let's practice creating more routes. In your dashboard, create two more pages:

Customers Page: The page should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/dashboard/customers. For now, it should return a <p>Customers Page</p> element.
Invoices Page: The invoices page should be accessible on http://localhost:3000/dashboard/invoices. For now, also return a <p>Invoices Page</p> element.
Spend some time tackling this exercise, and when you're ready, expand the toggle below for the solution:

Creating the dashboard layout
Dashboards have some sort of navigation that is shared across multiple pages. In Next.js, you can use a special layout.tsx file to create UI that is shared between multiple pages. Let's create a layout for the dashboard pages!

Inside the /dashboard folder, add a new file called layout.tsx and paste the following code:

/app/dashboard/layout.tsx

import SideNav from '@/app/ui/dashboard/sidenav';
 
export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen flex-col md:flex-row md:overflow-hidden">
      <div className="w-full flex-none md:w-64">
        <SideNav />
      </div>
      <div className="flex-grow p-6 md:overflow-y-auto md:p-12">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
A few things are going on in this code, so let's break it down:

First, you're importing the <SideNav /> component into your layout. Any components you import into this file will be part of the layout.

The <Layout /> component receives a children prop. This child can either be a page or another layout. In your case, the pages inside /dashboard will automatically be nested inside a <Layout /> like so:

Folder structure with dashboard layout nesting the dashboard pages as children
Check that everything is working correctly by saving your changes and checking your localhost. You should see the following:

Dashboard page with a sidenav and a main content area
One benefit of using layouts in Next.js is that on navigation, only the page components update while the layout won't re-render. This is called partial rendering:

Root layout
In Chapter 3, you imported the Inter font into another layout: /app/layout.tsx. As a reminder:

/app/layout.tsx

import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
This is called a root layout and is required. Any UI you add to the root layout will be shared across all pages in your application. You can use the root layout to modify your <html> and <body> tags, and add metadata (you'll learn more about metadata in a later chapter).

Since the new layout you've just created (/app/dashboard/layout.tsx) is unique to the dashboard pages, you don't need to add any UI to the root layout above.






























Optimizing Fonts and Images
In the previous chapter, you learned how to style your Next.js application. Let's continue working on your home page by adding a custom font and a hero image.

In this chapter...

Here are the topics we’ll cover

How to add custom fonts with next/font.

How to add images with next/image.

How fonts and images are optimized in Next.js.

Why optimize fonts?
Fonts play a significant role in the design of a website, but using custom fonts in your project can affect performance if the font files need to be fetched and loaded.

Cumulative Layout Shift is a metric used by Google to evaluate the performance and user experience of a website. With fonts, layout shift happens when the browser initially renders text in a fallback or system font and then swaps it out for a custom font once it has loaded. This swap can cause the text size, spacing, or layout to change, shifting elements around it.

Mock UI showing initial load of a page, followed by a layout shift as the custom font loads.
Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the application when you use the next/font module. It downloads font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

It’s time to take a quiz!
Test your knowledge and see what you’ve just learned.

How does Next.js optimize fonts?


A
It causes additional network requests which improve performance.

B
It disables all custom fonts.

C
It preloads all fonts at runtime.

D
It hosts font files with other static assets so that there are no additional network requests.
Adding a primary font
Let's add a custom Google font to your application to see how this works!

In your /app/ui folder, create a new file called fonts.ts. You'll use this file to keep the fonts that will be used throughout your application.

Import the Inter font from the next/font/google module - this will be your primary font. Then, specify what subset you'd like to load. In this case, 'latin':

/app/ui/fonts.ts

import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
Finally, add the font to the <body> element in /app/layout.tsx:

/app/layout.tsx

import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
By adding Inter to the <body> element, the font will be applied throughout your application. Here, you're also adding the Tailwind antialiased class which smooths out the font. It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch.

Navigate to your browser, open dev tools and select the body element. You should see Inter and Inter_Fallback are now applied under styles.

Practice: Adding a secondary font
You can also add fonts to specific elements of your application.

Now it's your turn! In your fonts.ts file, import a secondary font called Lusitana and pass it to the <p> element in your /app/page.tsx file. In addition to specifying a subset like you did before, you'll also need to specify the font weight.

Once you're ready, expand the code snippet below to see the solution.

Hints:

If you're unsure what weight options to pass to a font, check the TypeScript errors in your code editor.
Visit the Google Fonts website and search for Lusitana to see what options are available.
See the documentation for adding multiple fonts and the full list of options.
Finally, the <AcmeLogo /> component also uses Lusitana. It was commented out to prevent errors, you can now uncomment it:

/app/page.tsx

// ...
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-6">
      <div className="flex h-20 shrink-0 items-end rounded-lg bg-blue-500 p-4 md:h-52">
        <AcmeLogo />
        {/* ... */}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
Great, you've added two custom fonts to your application! Next, let's add a hero image to the home page.

Why optimize images?
Next.js can serve static assets, like images, under the top-level /public folder. Files inside /public can be referenced in your application.

With regular HTML, you would add an image as follows:


<img
  src="/hero.png"
  alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
/>
However, this means you have to manually:

Ensure your image is responsive on different screen sizes.
Specify image sizes for different devices.
Prevent layout shift as the images load.
Lazy load images that are outside the user's viewport.
Image Optimization is a large topic in web development that could be considered a specialization in itself. Instead of manually implementing these optimizations, you can use the next/image component to automatically optimize your images.

The <Image> component
The <Image> Component is an extension of the HTML <img> tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.
Adding the desktop hero image
Let's use the <Image> component. If you look inside the /public folder, you'll see there are two images: hero-desktop.png and hero-mobile.png. These two images are completely different, and they'll be shown depending if the user's device is a desktop or mobile.

In your /app/page.tsx file, import the component from next/image. Then, add the image under the comment:

/app/page.tsx

import AcmeLogo from '@/app/ui/acme-logo';
import { ArrowRightIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
import Link from 'next/link';
import { lusitana } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
import Image from 'next/image';
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    // ...
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-6 md:w-3/5 md:px-28 md:py-12">
      {/* Add Hero Images Here */}
      <Image
        src="/hero-desktop.png"
        width={1000}
        height={760}
        className="hidden md:block"
        alt="Screenshots of the dashboard project showing desktop version"
      />
    </div>
    //...
  );
}
Here, you're setting the width to 1000 and height to 760 pixels. It's good practice to set the width and height of your images to avoid layout shift, these should be an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

You'll also notice the class hidden to remove the image from the DOM on mobile screens, and md:block to show the image on desktop screens.

This is what your home page should look like now:

Styled home page with a custom font and hero image
Practice: Adding the mobile hero image
Now it's your turn! Under the image you've just added, add another <Image> component for hero-mobile.png.

The image should have a width of 560 and height of 620 pixels.
It should be shown on mobile screens, and hidden on desktop - you can use dev tools to check if the desktop and mobile images are swapped correctly.
Once you're ready, expand the code snippet below to see the solution.
