// Question 122: Use a while loop to count down from 10 to 1 and breaks the loop when it reaches 5.
// Explain & TIP: The break statement terminates the loop immediately. This is useful for stopping a loop when a certain condition is met, even if the loop's original termination condition hasn't been reached yet.
var count = 10;
while (count > 0) {
    if (count === 5) {
        break;
    }
    console.log(count);
    count--;
}
var names = ['ahmed', 'obaid', 'owais', 'shayan'];
var i = 0;
while (i < names.length) {
    if (names[i] === 'owais') {
        break;
    }
    console.log(names[i]);
    i++;
}
