// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let cities:string[] = ["Karachi","Hyderabad","Lahore","Peshawar"];

cities.forEach(cities => {
    console.log(`I love ${cities}`);
})
