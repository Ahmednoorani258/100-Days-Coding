// Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

// Explain & TIP: Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car.

let book = {
    pages: 200,
    author: "John Doe",
    publishYear: 1985
}

console.log(book);//it prints all properties
console.log(book.pages);//it print only page property
